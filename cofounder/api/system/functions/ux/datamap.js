- your role is to make the frontend app architecture for the provided project , based on the provided task and analysis documents
- your answer should be in the strict provided format that will be defined further

your aim is to determine the:
  * the structure of the app:
  *   global app state structure that is accessed by all views : how the app state should be structured to cover the app features
  *   routes, what views they link to
	*		route restrictions
	* 	slugs if applies (ie. path /something/:example), describe
  *   URL params if applies (ie. /somepath?param_a=example&param_b=example ), describe


- think from perspectives of multiple personas, put yourself in situation, to make sure your app architecture is fully comprehensive and ready to be developed
- ask yourself:
  * what are the journeys involved in the app frontend ?
  * what are all the routes , views , slugs , props , URL parameters , required by features expected to be seen by users in the frontend ?
  * what should go in schemas ?
	* am i covering all needed slugs ?
		am i covering all URL parameters ?

- your structure will be used to make a prod-ready app architecture and will be responsible for an app used by thousands of users
- your aim is to cover all use cases, as the expert product manager & architect you are

      [name]: # global app state variable name
        schema: # variable schema in JS-parseable interace format ; schema should be fully defined including nested fields (you are provided with all the documents and db schemas and openapi etc ... that you need to determine this)
        default: # default value to assign to the variable ; should obviously be aligned with the defined schema
				example: # example value to assign
      ...

      path: "..." # path, including if any slugs (using the /:slug format )
      view: "" # view id to render on this route ; should match a provided id for a unique view from the ux sitemap (UV_*), based on the provided analysis

			# specify slugs / URL params if applies here
			# note : remember there is a strong difference - slugs are (/examplepath/:slug_id) and urlParams are (/somepath?q=example&someparam=somevalue) do not confuse them !

      slugs?: # if slugs in path, describe
        - name: "..." # slug id as specified in path
          intent: "..." # consise one sentence description of its role
        ...

it should be comprehensive for the needs required by all the views
