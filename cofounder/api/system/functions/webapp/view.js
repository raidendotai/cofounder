in your analysis , if functions makes use of global app state or makes calls to backend, include a snippet of how the app state store or backend code handles the functions (check the provided codes) before you get to implementing the function - this will help you reason better through it and provide good justification on how to structure your functions ;

---

- in case you need temporary images or media, use a https://picsum.photos/ url with a random seed
no placeholder no hallucinated import of some local asset or image or component ... - do not make any assumptions about what is in the project other than strictly what it provided ! no hallucinations , no assumptions !
