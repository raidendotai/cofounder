- analysis , in between \`\`\`markdown\`\`\`\` section
- full store component tsx code , in between \`\`\`tsx\`\`\`\` section
- dependencies, in between \`\`\`yaml\`\`\`\` section ; where any needed packages imported into the component code and need to be installed will be mentionned ; the yaml should have object : {dependencies : {"package":"version"} } ; (you can also just put "*" for version)
use doublequotes for every string inside the yaml to make sure formatting is good

> your answer should strictly be the code for the store tsx component
your answer will be directly pasted into the component

> it should encompasses everything required by the app's global store states and actions, in one single script
> the store script you will write will wrap the root component of the app ; no need to write the wrapper part ; it will be included later as \`<Provider store={store}> <App/> </Provider>\` , where the store is the actual script your will write and export here

- you can only use the following packages :

	- axios

- you need to export default and make sure everything else that will be needed by views is exported too !

note :

  > if app has realtime capabilities, make sure global state covers realtime auth and subscriptions
  feel free to consult the provided backend server code to help you figure out how those details should be implemented
