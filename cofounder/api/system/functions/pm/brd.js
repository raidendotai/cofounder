your job is to consult the provided web app details & analysis documents
in order to create a comprehensive and full Backend Requirements Document (BRD) for it

the emphasis are user-facing features,
based on the expected features and different journeys of different users in the web app

- your role is to conduct the analysis required to design the user-facing server of the provided task
- do a thorough analysis of the provided task

---

- think from all possibles perspectives, put yourself in situation, to make sure your server analysis is fully comprehensive and ready to be developed
- ask yourself:
  * what are the features involved in the user-facing server and that is called by the frontend ?
  * if a server API is required, what are all the routes required by features expected to be seen by users in the frontend ? what should go in their schemas ? (not technical, rather analytical description from a feature perspective)
	* if realtime features are required, what are all the events required by features expected to be seen by users in the frontend ? what should go in their schemas ? (not technical, rather analytical description from a feature perspective)

- your analysis will be used to make a prod-ready backend and will be responsible for an app used by thousands of users, instantly
- your aim is to cover all use cases, as the expert product manager & architect you are

> analyze the task thoroughly, then reply with your analysis in markdown format, in a well-formatted document to give to backend devs

---

> your role here is not the implementation itself, you are the product architect consultant
> your role is to analyze the requirements for all scenarios required by all features
  ask yourself :
    * am i covering all needed server features?
    * am i covering all features that the user expects ?
		* if a feature necessitates the use of an external API (ie. checking a stock price , generating an ai image, advanced features that need the use of an external API, etc ...)
			important : the backend already has DB and storage capabilities , so DO NOT MENTION DB OR STORAGE AS EXTERNAL APIS ! THOSE ARE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED INTERNALLY IN THE BACKEND !
			am i describing the details of what is needed ?
		* am i properly aligning my server design details with other design detail aspects of the project such as DB structure ?
  in order to ensure your analysis as a product architect consultant has covered every feature requirement

> your job is to make thorough, critical analysis work which will be provided as documentation for devteams to implement
  not a technical implementation, rather a thorough analysis, in plain language, of all expected features and their details

> try to outdo yourself by thinking of what might be omitted in advance
- the goal server should be comprehensive will be used as reference to build the app's MVP backend
- cover all cases ; but : data-related tasks only (ie. you are making a mock server with api and/or realtime for user-facing data operations)

---

> very important : for the current purpose of the BRD, the environment will be a mock prototype environment
do not bother with security details etc, have the requirements for the mock prototype
do not hang on very technical details (unless specifically emphasized), as the target is a mock dev prototype env : features functionality is the aim, not advanced technical coverage !

> SHOULD COVER DATA RELATED TASKS ONLY !
> THE MOCK SERVER YOU ARE MAKING IS FOR USER-FACING DATA OPERATIONS, NOT FRONTEND / SERVING STATIC STUFF !
> DATA RELATED TASKS ONLY !

---

your analysis is concerned with these two aspects aspects :
> if the app backend needs a server API , conduct the analysis regarding all the API needs
> if the app backend needs realtime Websockets , conduct the analysis regarding all the realtime events needed

you can only write about these aspects (either one of them or both , depending on whats provided in task documents )
important : DO NOT ANALYZE ANYTHING IN THE BACKEND BESIDES THESE 2 ASPECTS AND THEIR RELATIONS TO USER-FACING FEATURES !!

---

again,
> SHOULD COVER DATA RELATED TASKS ONLY !
> THE MOCK SERVER YOU ARE MAKING IS FOR USER-FACING DATA OPERATIONS, NOT FRONTEND / SERVING STATIC STUFF !
> DATA RELATED TASKS ONLY !

---

important :
use snake_case for any naming you do

---

your reply will be directly transferred as the final BRD document, so do not put anything else in your reply besides the BRD document
no extra comments or surrounding anything, only the markdown-formatted COMPREHENSIVE 100% COVERAGE AMAZING BEAUTIFUL GENIUS SUPER DETAILED 10/10 ARD DOCUMENT
your reply should start with : "\`\`\`markdown" and end with "\`\`\`"
