ask yourself:		

	I.
	* am i covering shared global UI views in my analysis (ie. top navigation, footers, ...) in a separate section,
			which also details the components that share them ?
			am i assigning unique and expressive title-cased ids to them (in format "GV_{...}" ie. "GV_TopNav" ) ?
			am i careful to consider cases of authenticated/unauthenticated
			(whether conditionals regarding accessing the view itself or conditionals on its contained elements) to make sure my coverage is not missing things ?

  * am i covering all the needed unique UI views ; for all the required features ?
		am i assigning unique and expressive title-cased ids to them (in format "UV_{...}" ie. "UV_Landing" ) ?
		am i making sure unique views do not include duplicate shared global UI views which were already previously covered ?
		am i careful to consider cases of authenticated/unauthenticated (whether conditionals regarding accessing the view itself or conditionals on its contained elements) to make sure my coverage is not missing things ?

	* am i extensively describing everything in details for the dev team to have 100% coverage of everything needed through my UX Sitemap Document analysis ?

	* am i covering EVERYTHING expected to be present in this web app:
			every view (every unique view and every shared global view) expected to be in the app ?
			every view's components expected to be in the app to cover all 100% of features and all their details ?
			am i covering the views for all workflows, end to end ?

	* am i making sure i am covering the core and essential features / views , and not some optional secondary/tertiary not really required stuff ?

  II.
	* am i describing the functional and features analysis of each view before further detailing it in order to have a cohesive and comprehensive analysis and not omit any details ?
	* what are all the requirements needed by features expected to be seen by users in terms of UI views ( unique views and shared global views ) and contained views' components ?
	* cross analysis between feature <> ui views required to create in ux sitemap ?
	* what are ALL THE VIEWS required by ALL THE REQUIREMENTS required by the user ?
	* am i covering all views (unique views and shared global views) ?
		with all extensive details and descriptions ?
	* am i making sure i am covering the core and essential features / views , and not some optional secondary/tertiary not really required stuff ?

	III.
	can i make a table for all the cross links analysis between different views in order to establish inter-app navigation relationships ?
		can i describe their intent in each case ?
		can i also describe how the linking works (in terms of ui elements / user interaction / action taken to trigger the link and where in the view ) ?
	
		Source view | Target View | Intent | Action Description

	* am i covering 100% of relations links of whats needed for all in-app navigation, both static and dynamic ?
	* am i truly covering all inter-app cross links relations and not missing anything ?

> analyze the task thoroughly, then reply with your analysis in markdown format

> stick to the provided formats and specifications:
		UI unique views with ids UV_*
		UI global shared views with ids GV_*
	
		do not make up new denominations or types, stick to the task exactly as specified !

---

important :

> do not many any "Container" views (like some GV_GlobalContainer or something) ; DO NOT make any container views to contain other views inside of them !
	only make unique UV_* or GV_* shared views : views that serve a functional purpose ; not container views !

> GV_* shared views are INDEPENDENT from UV_* !
	UV_* views DO NOT INTEGRATE GV_* views inside them !
	they simply share screen space !!
	do not make any UV_* functionality dependent on GV_*
	do not make any GV_* functionality dependent on GV_*
	they are independent , they do not include each other , shared simply means sharing screen space , not functionalities !
