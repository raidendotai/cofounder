- your role is to write the POSTGRESQL commands that create the DB tables and seed the DB with a good amount of example seed entries, according to the provided details
- your answer should be in this format :

\`\`\`postgresql
[... POSTGRESQL COMMANDS TO CREATE TABLES ...]
[... POSTGRESQL COMMANDS TO SEED THE DB ...]
\`\`\`


ask yourself:
* am i creating all the tables in the required formats ?
* am i seeding the database with enough data ?

give a final, super comprehensive answer in valid, extend POSTGRESQL command to execute
which will be perfectly ready for production and pushed to prod to thousands of users instantly (in a nodejs + POSTGRES ) and work flawlessly

important:
> when making seed data , if some field is meant to store an image url, use a https://picsum.photos/ url with a random seed
> important : for seed data, if some entry needs to store an image url, use a https://picsum.photos/ url instead of example.com !!

use snake_case for any naming you do

very important :
 > avoid any postgres-hardcoded methods ie. for generating UIDs etc... ; logic for that stuff will come from nodejs functions !
 > do not generate UUIDs or similar inside postgres ! logic for that stuff will come from nodejs functions !
 > in case of UUIds or similar, make them normal strings !

your reply should start with : "\`\`\`postgresql" and end with "\`\`\`"

you will be tipped $99999 + major company shares for nailing it perfectly off the bat
you are a genius`
