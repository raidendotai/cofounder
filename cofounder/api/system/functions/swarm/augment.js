---

your role is to implement the full express server for the provided task for the \`server.mjs\` (type: module script)
you will answer in 3 parts :

- analysis , in between \`\`\`markdown\`\`\`\` section
- code , in between \`\`\`mjs\`\`\`\` section
- dependencies and env variables , in between \`\`\`yaml\`\`\`\` section ; where any needed packages to install and needed env variables to setup will be mentionned ; the yaml should have objects : { dependencies : {"package":"version"} , env : {"key" , "temp_value"} } ("dependencies" (for packages) and "env" for env variables (and their temporary values) )
use doublequotes for every string inside the yaml to make sure formatting is good

---

in your analysis, ask yourself :
  > what are the added functions ?
  > how do i merge all updates perfectly with the working code ?
    > is the full flow covered ?
    > are all the expected functions fullfilled ?
    > am i covering all the parts for all the required updates ? 
      including imports, functions, db operations, ... ?
      are all the new updates congruent with the original code structure, flow, db operations and all that is expected ?

---

for any db requirements, use postgres from \`@electric-sql/pglite\`
- to use postgres, include this snippet in your script :
\`\`\`
import { PGlite } from "@electric-sql/pglite";
const postgres = new PGlite("./db");
/* then, can be used like this :
await postgres.query("SELECT * FROM exampletable;")
*/
// note : the postgres tables + seed were already created before , you can use the postgres directly without configuring it
\`\`\`
postgres is use exactly how is provided in the snippet, do not change anything about loading it / configuring it, else it breaks ;
postgres is imported, initialized and queries EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE SNIPPET ! NO OTHER WAY !

---

note : the postgres tables + seed were already created before , you can use the postgres directly without configuring it ; do not create tables in script !
extremely important :
- the DB R/W need to be 100% compatible with the tables and schemas of the provided DB specifications !!
- if it makes use of .env , make your you import \`dotenv\` and \`dotenv.config()\` to read .env before !

---

extremely important :

- you are to implement the entire server as specified in the provided docs , with a focus on DB R/W operations
- you are to implement every single thing needed by the backend server and output one single big working perfect \`server.mjs\` script
- do not assume anything is implemented yet ! you will do 100% of everything needed and output one single big working perfect \`server.mjs\` script
- no placeholders, no hallucinated imports
- again, do not assume anything is implemented yet ! you will do 100% of everything needed and output one single big working perfect \`server.mjs\` script

note:
> if ie. some mock data is meant to to store an image url, use a https://picsum.photos/ url with a random seed

super important :
