# Early Alpha : Unstable

The following points are very emphasized :

- This is an EARLY, UNSTABLE, PREVIEW RELEASE of the project. ⚠️ Until v1 is released, it is expected to break often. 
- **It consumes a lot of tokens**. If you are on a tokens budget, wait until v1 is released.
- Again, this is an early, unstable release. A first test run. An early preview of the project's ideas. Far from completion. **Open-source iterative development**. Work in progress. Unstable early alpha release. [etc]

**If any of these might be issues for you, even in the slightest way, wait until v1 is released !**

## Important

**Early alpha release ; earlier than expected by 5/6 weeks**

Still not merged with key target features of the project, notably :
- project iteration modules for all dimensions of generated projects
- admin interface for event streams and (deeper) project iterations
- integrate the full genUI plugin :
  * generative design systems
  * deploy finetuned models & serve from api.cofounder
- local, browser-based dev env for the entire project scope
- add react-native , flutter , other web frameworks 
- validations & swarm code review and autofix
- code optimization
- [...]

be patient :)
